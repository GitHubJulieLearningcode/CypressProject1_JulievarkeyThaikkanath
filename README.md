# Cypress End-to-End Testing Framework

## Description

Cypress is an exciting new technology that enhances confidence through practical implementation. As a passionate automation engineer, I've utilized Cypress to develop an end-to-end testing framework tailored for [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Features

- **Automated Tests:** Comprehensive tests covering user authentication, product search, shopping cart, and checkout processes.
- **Page Object Model:** Structured for maintainability and scalability.
- **Random Data Generation:** Utility functions for dynamic testing.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensures compatibility across multiple browsers.
- **Independent Test Cases:** Each test case runs independently for robustness and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Cypress:** End-to-end testing framework.
- **JavaScript:** Scripting language for writing tests.

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) Stages

### Requirement Analysis

Conducted thorough requirement analysis to understand the application features and testing needs.

### Test Case Design

Designed test cases based on requirements and documented them in Excel for clarity and traceability.

### Implementation

- Adopted the Page Object Model for structured test automation.
- Created separate page objects for each webpage, encapsulating selectors and methods.
- Followed best practices for Cypress and implemented the framework efficiently.

### Optimization

- Focused on reducing code length to improve maintainability and quality.
- Ensured all test cases are independent and self-contained.
